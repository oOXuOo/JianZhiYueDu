<p>如果我能再活一次（双语有声美文）</p>
<p>If I Had My Life to Live Over</p>
<p>如果我能再活一次</p>
<p>I would have gone to bed when I was sick instead of pretending the earth would go into a holding pattern if I weren't there for the day.</p>
<p>生病的时候我就卧床休息，不会假装自己一天不工作，地球就会停止转动。</p>
<p>I would have burned the pink candle sculpted like a rose before it melted in storage.</p>
<p>我要将雕成玫瑰花状的粉红蜡烛点上，而不让它在闲置中溶化。</p>
<p>I would have eaten the popcorn in the “good” living room and worried much less about the dirt when someone wanted to light a fire in the fireplace.</p>
<p>我要在“讲究”的客厅里吃爆玉米花。倘若有人在壁炉生火带出了炉灰，我不会操那么多闲心。</p>
<p>I would never have insisted the car windows be rolled up on a summer day because my hair had just been teased and sprayed.</p>
<p>我决不会因为夏天头发刚刚梳理过、喷过发胶，就一定要把车窗玻璃摇起来。</p>
<p>I would have cried and laughed less while watching television—and more while watching life.</p>
<p>看电视我要少哭一点，少笑一点，看生活我要多哭一点，多笑一点。</p>
<p>I would never have bought anything just because it was practical, wouldn't show soil, or was guaranteed to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>我买东西不会只看它很实用，不显脏，或能保证用一辈子。</p>
<p>But mostly, given another shot at life, I would seize every minute…look at it and really see it … live it … and never give it back.</p>
<p>但总的来说，如果再让我活一回，我要把握好分分秒秒，留心生活，真正关注生活，品味生活，决不使岁月蹉跎。</p>
<p>Don't worry about who doesn't like you, who has more money, or who's doing what. Instead, let's cherish the relationships we have with those who do love us. Let's think about what God has blessed us with, and what we are doing each day to promote ourselves mentally, physically, emotionally.</p>
<p>不担心谁不喜欢我，谁比我富有，或者谁在干什么。让我们珍惜与真心关爱我们的人之间那份感情。让我们多想想上帝赐予我们的福分。多想想我们每天做了哪些有益于自己思想、身体、感情和精神的事。</p>
