<p>你在忽略那些小想法吗？</p>
<p>What happened to that brilliant idea that you once had? Did you ignore it because you thought that it was just a little thought?</p>
<p>你曾经想到过的那个非凡的主意后来怎样了？ 你是否因为觉得那只是个小小的念头而将其忽略了呢？</p>

<p>你是否考虑过， 如果你依照直觉行事，或是多用点心，当初那个小小的念头将会变成怎样？</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario ,where you are sitting at home watching television or reading a book , suddenly a light buld is turned on in the dark tunnel of your mind as a thought or an idea crosses your mind . The thought catches your attention but seems so meaningless and you are tempted to discard it , but wait a minute !</p>
<p>想像这样一个场景：你正坐在家里看电视或看书，一个想法或念头闪过脑际，令你眼前一亮， 豁然开朗。这个想法虽然令你心中为之一动，但却似乎毫无意义，于是你打算放弃它。但是请等一下！</p>
<p>That thought could be the potential beginning of the success you have so much yearned for . As the thought crosses your mind, your senses become alert and you suddenly see a possibility , a realization , a solution , a conclusion , or find the answer to a problem whose solution has long eluded you .</p>
<p>那个想法可能就是你渴望已久的潜在的成功起点 。当它在你头脑中闪过时，你的思维变得敏锐起来，你突然看到了一种可能性、一种想法的实现、一个解决方案、一个结论，或是找到让你困惑已久的问题的答案。</p>
<p>It is almost as if a divine being has whispered the perfect solution into your ear or awakened your senses to a reality thereby bringing illumination to your life . It is like finding the last piece of jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>这就像是一位圣人在你耳边低语，告诉你最佳的解决方案， 或者将你的思维唤回到现实，从而给你的人生带来光明。这就像是找到智力拼图的最后一块一样。</p>
<p>This becomes an AHA moment and everything freezes around you as you excitedly try to grasp the practicality of that little but powerful thought .</p>

<p>当你意识到，如果实践那个小小是想法，就会产生极大的可能性时，你的自信心就会增强，热情也会高涨。此时，你要以那个小小的想法为基础，记下由其激发出的所有念头，以便日后回顾。</p>
<p>Seemingly meaningless little thought or ideas when acted upon have a potential to explode into great projects .</p>

<p>You may have heard people say many times that it just came to me in a flash moment , a small idea or seemingly meaningless thought may cross your mind about something you have been planning to accomplish .</p>
<p>你可能听别人多次说过：我瞬间有了那个想法。闪念之间，一个与你一直计划实现的事情有关的小点子或看似毫无意义的想法，就可能会在你脑中闪过。</p>
