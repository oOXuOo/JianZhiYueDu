<p>我现在就付诸行动（双语有声美文）</p>
<p>The Scroll Marked IX 羊皮卷之九</p>
<p>My dreams are worthless, my plans are dust, my goals are impossible.</p>
<p>我的幻想毫无价值，我的计划渺如尘埃，我的目标不可能达到。</p>
<p>All are of no value unless they are followed by action.</p>
<p>一切的一切毫无意义－－除非我们付诸行动。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>Never has there been a map, however carefully executed to detail and scale, which carried its owner over even one inch of ground. Never has there been a parchment of law, however fair, which prevented one crime. Never has there been a scroll, even such as the one I hold, which earned so much as a penny or produced a single word of acclamation. Action, alone, is the tinder which ignites the map, the parchment, this scroll, my dreams, my plans, my goals, into a living force. Action is the food and drink which will nourish my success.</p>
<p>一张地图，不论多么详尽，比例多精确，它永远不能带着它的主人在地面上移动半步。一个国家的法律，不论多么公正，永远不可能防止罪恶的发生。任何宝典，即使在我手中的羊皮卷，永远不可能创造财富。只有行动才能使地图、法律、宝典、梦想、计划、目标具有现实意义。行动，像食物和水一样，能滋润我，使我成功。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>My procrastination which has held me back was born of fear and now I recognize this secret mined from the depths of all courageous hearts. Now I know that to conquer fear I must always act without hesitation and the flutters in my heart will vanish. Now I know that action reduces the lion of terror to an ant of equanimity.</p>
<p>拖延使我裹足不前，它来自恐惧。现在我从所有勇敢的心灵深处，体会到这一秘密。我知道，想克服恐惧，必须毫不犹豫，起而行动，唯其如此，心中的慌乱方得以平定。现在我知道，行动会使猛狮般的恐惧，减缓为蚂蚁般的平静。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>Henceforth, I will remember the lesson of the firefly who gives of its light only when it is on the wing, only when it is in action. I will become a firefly and even in the day my glow will be seen in spite of the sun. Let others be as butterflies who preen their wings yet depend on the charity of a flower for life. I will be as the firefly and my light will brighten the world.</p>
<p>从此我要记住萤火虫的启迪：只有振翅的时候，才能发出光芒。我要成为一只萤火虫，即使在艳阳高照的白天，我也要发出光芒。让别人像蝴蝶一样。舞动翅膀，靠花朵的施舍生活；我要做萤火虫，照亮大地。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>I will not avoid the tasks of today and charge them to tomorrow for I know that tomorrow never comes. Let me act now even though my actions may not bring happiness or success for it is better to act and fail than not to act and flounder. Happiness, in truth, may not be the fruit plucked by my action yet without action all fruit will die on the vine.</p>
<p>我不把今天的事情留给明天，因为我知道明天是永远不会来临的。现在就付诸行动吧！即使我的行为不会带来快乐与成功，但是动而失败总比坐而待毙好。行动也许不会结出快乐的果实，但没有行动，所有的果实都无法收获。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>I will act now. I will act now. I will act now. Henceforth, I will repeat these words again and again and again, each hour, each day, every day, until the words become as much a habit as my breathing and the actions which follow become as instinctive as the blinking of my eyelids. With these words I can condition my mind to perform every act necessary for my success. With these words I can condition my mind to meet every challenge which the failure avoids.</p>
<p>立即行动。立即行动。立即行动。从今往后，我要一遍又一遍，每时每刻重复这句话，直到成为习惯，好比呼吸一般，成为本能，好比眨眼一样。有了这句话，我就能调整自己的情绪，迎接失败者逃避而远之的每一次挑战。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>I will repeat these words again and again and again.</p>
<p>我一遍又一遍地重复这句话。</p>
<p>When I awake I will say them and leap from my cot while the failure sleeps yet another hour.</p>
<p>清晨醒来时，失败者流连于床榻，我却要默诵这句话，然后开始行动。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>When I enter the market place I will say them and immediately confront my first prospect while the failure ponders yet his possibility of rebuff.</p>
<p>外出推销时，失败者还在考虑是否遭到拒绝的时候，我要默诵着句话，面对第一个来临的顾客。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>When I face a closed door I will say them and knock while the failure waits outside with fear and trepidation.</p>
<p>面对紧闭的大门，失败者怀着恐惧与惶惑的心情，在门外等候；我默诵着句话，随即上前敲门。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>When I face temptation I will say them and immediately act to remove myself from evil.</p>
<p>面对诱惑时，我默诵这句话，然后远离罪恶。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>When I am tempted to quit and begin again tomorrow I will say them and immediately act to consummate another sale.</p>
<p>当我想放弃明天再开始的时候，我会默念这句话，然后立即行动去推销又一件产品。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>Only action determines my value in the market place and to multiply my value I will multiply my actions. I will walk where the failure fears to walk. I will work when the failure seeks rest. I will talk when the failure remains silent. I will call on ten who can buy my goods while the failure makes grand plans to call on one. I will say it is done before the failure says it is too late.</p>
<p>只有行动才能决定我在商场上的价值。若要加倍我的价值，我必须加倍努力。我要前往失败者惧怕的地方，当失败者休息的时候，我要继续工作。失败者沉默的时候，我开口推销，我要拜访十户可能买我东西的人家，而失败者在一番周详的计划之后，却只拜访一家。在失败者认为太晚时，我能够说大功告成。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>For now is all I have. Tomorrow is the day reserved for the labor of the lazy. I am not lazy. Tomorrow is the day when the evil become good. I am not evil. Tomorrow is the day when the weak become strong. I am not weak. Tomorrow is the day when the failure will succeed. I am not a failure.</p>
<p>现在是我的所有。明日是为懒汉保留的工作日，我并不懒惰。明日是弃恶从善的日子，我并不邪恶。明日是弱者变强者的日子，我并不软弱。明日是失败者借口成功的日子，我并不是失败。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>When the lion is hungry he eats. When the eagle has thirst he drinks. Lest they act, both will perish.</p>
<p>我是雄狮，我是苍鹰，饥即食，渴即饮。除非行动，否则死路一条。</p>
<p>I hunger for success. I thirst for happiness and peace of mind. Lest I act I will perish in a life of failure, misery, and sleepless nights.</p>
<p>我渴望成功，快乐，心灵的平静。除非行动，否则我将在失败、不幸、夜不成眠的日子中死亡。</p>
<p>I will command, and I will obey my own command.</p>
<p>我发布命令。我要服从自己的命令。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
<p>Success will not wait. If I delay she will become betrothed to another and lost to me forever.</p>
<p>成功不是等待。如果我迟疑，她会投入别人的怀抱，永远弃我而去。</p>
<p>This is the time. This is the place. I am the man.</p>
<p>此时。此地。此人。</p>
<p>I will act now.</p>
<p>我现在就付诸行动。</p>
