<p>我喜欢你是静静的（双语有声美文）</p>
<p>I like for you to be still</p>
<p>我喜欢你是静静的</p>
<p>I like for you to be still: it is as though you are absent


　　and you hear me from far away and my voice does not touch you


　　It seems as though your eyes had flown away


　　and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth</p>
<p>我喜欢你是静静的：仿佛你消失了一样


　　你从远处聆听我，我的声音却无法触及你


　　好像你的目光已经游离飘去


　　如同一个吻，封缄了你的嘴</p>
<p>As all things are filled with my soul


　　you emerge from the things, filled with my soul


　　You are like my soul, a butterfly of dreams


　　and you are like the word Melancholy</p>
<p>如同我积满一切的灵魂


　　而你从一切中出现，充盈了我的灵魂


　　你像我的灵魂，像一只梦想的蝴蝶


　　你如同“忧郁”这个词</p>
<p>I like for you to be still, and you seem far away


　　It sounds as though you are lamenting, a butterfly cooing like a dove


　　And you hear me from far away, and my voice does not reach you


　　Let me come to be still in your silence</p>
<p>我喜欢你是静静的，好像你已远去


　　你听起来像在悲叹，一只如鸽般喁喁细语的蝴蝶


　　你从远处聆听我，我的声音却无法触及你


　　让我在你的恬谧中安静无声</p>
<p>And let me talk to you with your silence


　　that is bright as a lamp, simple as a ring


　　You are like the night, with its stillness and constellations


　　Your silence is that of a star, as remote and candid</p>
<p>并且让我藉着你的沉默与你说话


　　你的沉默亮若明灯，简单如环


　　你如黑夜，拥有寂静与群星


　　你的沉默就是星星的沉默，遥远而明亮</p>
<p>I like for you to be still: it is as though you are absent


　　distant and full of sorrow, as though you had died


　　One word then, one smile, is enough


　　And I'm happy, happy that it's not true</p>
<p>我喜欢你是静静的：仿佛你消失了一样


　　远隔千里，满怀哀恸，仿佛你已不在人世


　　彼时，一个字，一个微笑，就已足够


　　而我会感到幸福，因那不是真的而感到幸福</p>
